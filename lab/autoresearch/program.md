# Autoresearch Program — Elixir/Phoenix Plugin Skills

## Goals (ordered by priority)

1. Fix accuracy issues: stale cross-references, missing agents/skills
2. Improve conciseness: compress bloated sections, move detail to references/
3. Strengthen Iron Laws: add missing prohibitions, ensure min coverage
4. Improve triggering: add domain keywords to generic descriptions
5. Fill completeness gaps: missing sections, undocumented flags
6. Improve clarity: raise action density, remove cross-section duplication
7. Improve specificity: add code examples, concrete patterns over vague guidance

## Mutable Surface (ONLY these files)

- `plugins/elixir-phoenix/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `plugins/elixir-phoenix/skills/*/references/*.md`

## Read-Only (NEVER mutate)

- `lab/**` (eval infrastructure, this file, scripts)
- `plugins/elixir-phoenix/agents/**`
- `plugins/elixir-phoenix/hooks/**`
- `plugins/elixir-phoenix/.claude-plugin/**`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `README.md`

## Scoring

- 7 dimensions: completeness, accuracy, conciseness, triggering, safety, clarity, specificity
- Composite = weighted average (0.20, 0.15, 0.15, 0.10, 0.10, 0.15, 0.15)
- Eval definitions: `lab/eval/evals/{skill}.json` (skill-specific) or default
- Scorer: `python3 -m lab.eval.scorer {skill_path}`

## Keep Threshold

Keep if `new_composite >= previous_best_composite`.
On exact tie: keep (prefer newer — likely simpler or more accurate).

## Stop Conditions

- All target skills at composite >= 0.95
- 10 consecutive discards on same skill -> skip that skill
- 50 total consecutive discards -> stop entirely
- Human interrupts (Ctrl+C)

## Anti-Thrashing Rules

- Same skill mutated 5+ times without improvement: skip for 10 iterations
- If composite hasn't improved in 20 iterations: switch strategy
- NEVER revert a mutation that improved one dimension unless another regressed by MORE
- After a discard: analyze WHY before next attempt on same skill (ReflexiCoder)
- NEVER retry the exact same mutation type on the same section twice

## Simplicity Criterion

A 0.01 improvement that adds 10 lines of content? Probably not worth it.
A 0.01 improvement from removing redundancy? Definitely keep.
All else equal, shorter is better.
